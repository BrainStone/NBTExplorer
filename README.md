# NBTExplorerPPA

This project is used to package [NBTExplorer](https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer) as a
[PPA](https://launchpad.net/~brainstone/+archive/ubuntu/nbtexplorer).

I highly doubt I'll do this the best way, but this intended as a learning experience.

## What's included

- `nbtexplorer` package, which contains just NBTExplorer
- `nbtutil` package, which contains just NBTUtil
- `nbtexplorer-complete` package, which contains both
